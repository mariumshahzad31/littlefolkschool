This school website project was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 as part of an SMIT frontend development assignment. CSS and Bootstrap were used together to style the website with a clean red and white color theme, responsive layout, and consistent typography across all pages. The site includes multiple sections like Home, About, Admissions, Academics, Activities, Results, Testimonials, Careers, Contact, and Login, all connected through a fully functional navigation bar. The project reflects a solid understanding of web page structure, styling techniques, and the use of Bootstrap components for responsiveness and layout.
